## Music Discovery App
The Music Discovery App is a project that utilizes the Spotify API to provide personalized music recommendations. Users can enter the name of an artist, and the app will display a list of the artist's top songs fetched from the Spotify API. It's a great way to explore the top tracks of favorite artists and discover new music.

To use the app, follow these steps:

1. Create a Spotify Developer application and obtain the Client ID and Client Secret.
2. Set the SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID and SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET environment variables on your machine.

The app will use the Spotify API to fetch artist names, genres, and song titles, tailoring the music recommendations to individual preferences.

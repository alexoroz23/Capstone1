## Music Recommendation Engine
This project utilizes the Spotify API to create a Music Recommendation Engine. The aim is to provide personalized music recommendations based on user preferences and listening habits.

Spotify API
The Spotify API is a powerful tool that allows developers to access a wide range of music-related data. By integrating the Spotify API into this project, we can fetch information about artists, genres, and songs. This data forms the foundation for generating personalized music recommendations for users.

To use the Spotify API in this project, follow these steps:

Visit the Spotify Developer Dashboard and create a new application.

Obtain the Client ID and Client Secret from your Spotify application's dashboard.

Set the environment variables SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID and SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET on your local machine. Assign them the values of your Spotify API credentials.

With the Spotify API integrated, the project will be able to fetch artist names, genres, song titles, and more to provide personalized recommendations to users.

Feel free to explore the Spotify API documentation for more details on the available endpoints and how to interact with the API.
